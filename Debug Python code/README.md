# Debug Python Code

In this lab, I practiced identifying and fixing different types of bugs in Python code, including syntax errors, exceptions, and logic errors. Debugging is a vital skill when writing automation scripts, building tools, or working in incident response and log analysis.

## Tasks Completed

- Applied step-by-step debugging to fix broken code  
- Identified and corrected syntax errors (e.g., missing colons, incorrect indentation)  
- Handled exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` and `KeyError` using `try`/`except`  
- Resolved logical mistakes that caused incorrect outputs  

## Skills Gained

- Debugging and troubleshooting broken code  
- Using `print()` statements and structured logic to isolate issues  
- Writing more resilient code with `try/except` blocks and better logic flow  

This lab directly supports the problem-solving mindset required in cybersecurity roles, especially when scripts, tools, or detection rules donâ€™t behave as expected.
