# Create Loops

In this lab, I practiced using Python loops to automate repetitive tasks, which is important for monitoring and managing cybersecurity systems efficiently.

## Tasks Completed

- Created a simple loop simulating attempts to connect to a network  
- Used a `for` loop to compare allowed IP addresses with login attempt IPs  
- Implemented a `while` loop to generate unique employee IDs by iterating through numbers  

## Skills Gained

- Writing `for` and `while` loops to automate processes  
- Applying loops to analyze login activity and enforce network security  
- Enhancing scripting skills to handle repetitive cybersecurity tasks  

This lab helped me build automation skills useful for real-world security monitoring and management.
