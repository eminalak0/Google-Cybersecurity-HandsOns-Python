# Assign Python Variables

In this lab, I practiced assigning variables of different data types in Python and checking their types using the `type()` function. Understanding variables is fundamental for programming and scripting in cybersecurity.

## Tasks Completed

- Assigned variables with various data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans  
- Used the `type()` function to identify the data type of each variable  

## Skills Gained

- Understanding Python data types and variable assignment  
- Using built-in functions to inspect variable types  
- Writing clear and effective Python code with proper data management

This lab strengthened my ability to work with variables and data types, essential for scripting and automation in cybersecurity.
