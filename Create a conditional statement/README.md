# Create a Conditional Statement

In this lab, I practiced writing Python conditional statements to make decisions based on specific conditions, an essential skill for automating security checks and analyzing logs.

## Tasks Completed

- Wrote code to determine if a userâ€™s operating system requires an update  
- Developed logic to check if login attempts were made by approved users  
- Added conditions to verify if login attempts occurred during authorized organization hours  

## Skills Gained

- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python to control program flow  
- Implementing conditional logic to automate security validations  
- Strengthening Python coding skills for cybersecurity automation and analysis  

This lab improved my ability to write code that reacts dynamically to security-related data.
