# Use Regular Expressions to Find Patterns

In this lab, I practiced using Python's `re` module (regular expressions) to extract device IDs and IP addresses from logs — a key skill in cybersecurity for identifying suspicious activity or parsing data at scale.

## Tasks Completed

- Extracted device IDs from a simulated log using regex patterns  
- Extracted all IP addresses from a log file  
- Compared extracted IPs against a list of flagged/suspicious IPs  

## Skills Gained

- Writing and applying regular expressions for pattern matching  
- Using regex to extract specific fields from logs (e.g., IPs, device IDs)  
- Performing comparisons against threat intelligence or known bad IPs  

This lab gave me essential experience in using Python to process and analyze system logs — critical for threat detection, SIEM analysis, and automation.
