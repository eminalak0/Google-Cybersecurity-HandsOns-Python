# Work with Strings in Python

In this lab, I practiced manipulating string data in Python — a critical skill for working with logs, parsing data, and handling identifiers in cybersecurity. I used built-in functions and string indexing to extract meaningful information from structured inputs like URLs and device IDs.

## Tasks Completed

- Used `str()` to convert numbers into strings and `len()` to measure string length  
- Concatenated strings to format employee ID data  
- Used bracket notation (indexing) to extract specific characters or segments from strings like device IDs  
- Applied `.index()` method and slicing to extract URL components  

## Skills Gained

- String conversion and concatenation for handling user/device data  
- Navigating string content using indexing and slicing  
- Extracting and analyzing structured data from logs, URLs, and identifiers — useful for tasks like phishing detection or log parsing  

This lab helped reinforce Python’s string-handling features, which are frequently used in cybersecurity scripting and automation.
