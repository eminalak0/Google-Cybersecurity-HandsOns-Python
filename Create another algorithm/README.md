# Create Another Algorithm

In this lab, I developed an algorithm to update an allowlist of IP addresses by removing unauthorized entries. This simulated a basic access control system, helping reinforce skills in data parsing and rule-based automation.

## Tasks Completed

- Imported a text file containing an allowlist of IP addresses  
- Parsed the file content and stored it as a list  
- Created a Python algorithm that removes IP addresses no longer permitted access  
- Output the updated allowlist for future reference  

## Skills Gained

- File reading and data parsing using Python  
- List filtering and logic to manage access control  
- Building algorithms that simulate real-world tasks like IP allowlisting and revocation  

This hands-on lab is useful for tasks like managing firewall rules, access logs, and dynamic allow/deny lists in cybersecurity operations.
