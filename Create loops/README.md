# Create Loops

In this lab, I practiced writing Python loops to automate repetitive tasks, a crucial skill in cybersecurity for processing logs and managing data efficiently.

## Tasks Completed

- Created a simple loop simulating connecting to a network  
- Used a `for` loop to compare login IP addresses with allowed IP addresses  
- Implemented a `while` loop to generate unique employee IDs by iterating through numbers  

## Skills Gained

- Using `for` loops to iterate over lists and compare data  
- Using `while` loops for generating sequences and automating tasks  
- Strengthening Python programming skills for cybersecurity automation and analysis  

This lab helped me automate tasks that are common in monitoring and managing security operations.
