# Import and Parse a Text File

In this lab, I worked with text file handling in Python, focusing on how to read, parse, modify, and create text-based data — a common task when dealing with logs, configuration files, or user records in cybersecurity environments.

## Tasks Completed

- Imported and stored the contents of a `.txt` file into a string  
- Used the `.split()` method to convert string content into a list  
- Appended new data to an existing file  
- Created and wrote to a brand new text file  

## Skills Gained

- Reading and writing `.txt` files using Python  
- Converting raw text into structured data with `.split()`  
- Appending and creating files — useful for generating log reports or security audit notes  

This hands-on activity was key to understanding file I/O operations, which are often needed in scripting, auditing, and log management tasks in cybersecurity.
