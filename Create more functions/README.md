# Create More Functions

In this lab, I practiced working with both built-in and custom Python functions to analyze failed login attempts. These types of tasks are commonly used in cybersecurity to detect anomalies, identify brute-force attacks, and automate daily log monitoring.

## Tasks Completed

- Applied built-in functions `max()` and `sorted()` to analyze a list of failed login attempts  
- Defined a function to compare the number of login attempts for the current day with the average  
- Returned analysis results from the custom function for further reporting or alerting  

## Skills Gained

- Using Python’s built-in functions for data analysis  
- Writing custom functions that accept input, process data, and return results  
- Automating repetitive analysis tasks — essential for real-world SOC and security operations  

This lab demonstrated how Python can be used to simplify routine cybersecurity monitoring and make threat detection more efficient.
