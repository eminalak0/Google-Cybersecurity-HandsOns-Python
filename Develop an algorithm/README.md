# Develop an Algorithm

In this lab, I created a basic Python algorithm that simulates user access control by managing lists of users and their devices. This is directly relevant to cybersecurity tasks like identity verification, access management, and basic system auditing.

## Tasks Completed

- Used `.append()` and `.remove()` to dynamically manage user and device lists  
- Wrote logic to determine if a user is approved to access the system  
- Used `.index()` and list indexing to match users with their associated devices  

## Skills Gained

- Building simple algorithms to simulate access control logic  
- Managing user/device lists using Python methods  
- Writing conditional logic based on list contents and indices — useful for basic identity verification and access logging systems  

This lab gave me practical experience building logical workflows — the foundation of writing scripts and tools for security automation.
